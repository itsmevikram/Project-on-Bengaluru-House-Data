# Project-on-Bengaluru-House-Data
Project on ML Model

1.The Project is based on creating a regression model using Machine Learning Algorithm.
2.It shows the application of dealing with missing values.
3.It also shows on how to deal with outliers in a data and restructuring of data for ML model, using feature engineering techniques.
4.Moreover, it shows the cross validation techniques to find the best regression model which fits the cleaned preprocessed data with best performance.
5.A project which shows implementation of various statistical methods of data Science followed by Machine Learning.

#Challenges

1.After Learning Data Science,this was my first project which I worked on.
2.It took me 1 week to complete this project because initially it was like, "Where should I start from?.".
3.But finally with knowledge and advises from my beloved Faculty I found out various ways to solve it.
4.Usually in Learning Institutes they teach every step on how a Machine Learning Algorithm works with suitable practical examples,but its always different when you are handing 
with a diffent type of data which is not same as what you got on your practical sessions.

Stay Tuned for another amazing project on Regression Analysis,I am coming with on next week.
